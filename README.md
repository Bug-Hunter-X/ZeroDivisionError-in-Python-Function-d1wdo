This repository contains a simple Python function that demonstrates the common error of division by zero. The file `bug.py` contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version.  The error occurs when the function attempts to divide a number by zero, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError`. The solution implements exception handling to gracefully manage the error case.
